And they went, and came into an harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.\nAnd it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.\nAnd the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.\nAnd the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they\nwere:\nAnd it came to pass\nabout the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.\nBut she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.\nAnd the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.\nAnd before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;\nAnd she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.\nFor we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that\nwere on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.\nAnd as soon as we had heard\nthese things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he\nis God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.\nNow therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father’s house, and give me a true token:\nAnd\nthat ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.\nAnd the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.\nThen she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house\nwas upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.\nAnd she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.\nAnd the men said unto her, We\nwill be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.\nBehold,\nwhen we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household, home unto thee.\nAnd it shall be,\nthat whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood\nshall be upon his head, and we\nwill be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood\nshall be on our head, if\nany hand be upon him.\nAnd if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.\nAnd she said, According unto your words, so\nbe it.

All the widows stood around Peter, showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made. Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, 'Tabitha, get up.' She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.",

When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.\nBut Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning\nhim to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.\nAnd he gave her\nhis hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive."
