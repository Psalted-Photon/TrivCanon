And she said,\nIt shall be\n well.\nThen she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not\nthy riding for me, except I bid thee.\nSo she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold,\nyonder is that Shunammite:\nRun now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her,\nIs it\n well with thee?\nis it well with thy husband?\nis it\n well with the child? And she answered,\nIt is well.\nAnd when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul\nis vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid\nit from me, and hath not told me.\nThen she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?\nThen he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.\nAnd the mother of the child said,\nAs the LORD liveth, and\nas thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.\nAnd Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but\nthere was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.\nAnd when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead,\nand laid upon his bed.\nHe went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD.\nAnd he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.\nThen he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.\nAnd he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.\nThen she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out."
